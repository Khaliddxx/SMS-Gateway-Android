# SMS-Gateway-Android

An SMS gateway system is implemented through API's on a backend server designed by NodeJS and mariaDB version of mySQL. The API's are properly functional as tested using Postman. Furthermore, the respective gateway application is designed on android studio. The functionality is limited to showing a text view of sent messages, which is not fully operative yet to run the API's. The project folders are attached below alongside the android package 'APK'.
